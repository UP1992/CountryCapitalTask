Country–Capital Matching Game (React + Vite)

A simple and interactive matching game built using React, Vite, and clean component-based architecture.
The user selects a country and then tries to match it with the correct capital.
Correct pairs highlight in green and disappear; wrong pairs highlight in red and show a temporary message.
